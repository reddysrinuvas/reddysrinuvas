        Plant growth regulators (PGRs) are natural or synthetic compounds that exert control over the growth and development of plants. These substances regulate physiological processes at low concentrations, influencing plant growth, flowering, fruit development, and responses to environmental stimuli.
        
        1. Types of Plant Growth Regulators:
        
        Auxins: Auxins regulate cell elongation, root formation, apical dominance, and fruit development. They're used in tissue culture, rooting powders, and to prevent premature fruit drop.
        
        Gibberellins: Gibberellins control stem elongation, seed germination, and flowering. They're applied to promote flowering in certain plants and increase fruit size.
        
        Cytokinins: Cytokinins influence cell division, delay aging in leaves, and stimulate shoot and root growth. They're used in tissue culture to promote shoot multiplication.
        
        Abscisic Acid (ABA): ABA regulates dormancy, seed development, and stress responses, aiding in seed dormancy and stress tolerance.
        
        Ethylene: Ethylene influences fruit ripening, senescence, and responses to stress. It's used in agriculture to control fruit ripening and reduce post-harvest losses.</p>
