       <p style="width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 20px;">"Herbaceous" refers to plants with soft, non-woody stems that typically die back to the ground at the end of the growing season. These plants lack persistent woody tissue, distinguishing them from trees and shrubs. Common examples of herbaceous plants include flowers like tulips and daisies, as well as vegetables like lettuce and spinach. The term is often used in botany and gardening to describe a specific growth habit rather than a taxonomic category, highlighting the plant's characteristics rather than its genetic classification. Herbaceous plants play a crucial role in adding seasonal color and texture to gardens, and their adaptability allows them to thrive in various climates and soil conditions.</p>
