       <p style="width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 20px;">Cacti and succulents are types of plants adapted to arid environments, known for their water-storing capabilities. Cacti belong to the Cactaceae family and are characterized by unique structures called areoles, from which spines, flowers, and sometimes branches emerge. These plants are native to the Americas and often associated with deserts. Succulents, on the other hand, encompass a broader range of plant families and have thick, fleshy leaves or stems that store water. They are found in various global regions and include popular ornamental species like Aloe vera and Echeveria. Both cacti and succulents have evolved specialized features to thrive in dry conditions, making them resilient and well-suited for indoor and outdoorÂ cultivation.</p>
